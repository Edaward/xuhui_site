My name is Xuhui Zhou. I am a NLP master student at the University of Washington (UW). I got my bachelor degree in Statistics at Nanjing University (NJU). I spent my junior year at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) participating in an international student program, where I made up my mind researching language technologies. 

My research interests include natural language processing (NLP), and their application in computational social science. Here is my [CV](/report/Xuhui_Zhou_cv.pdf).
