  My goal is to make machines “dance” more elegantly in the human-machine conversation—written or spoken, synchronous or asynchronous—through the development of NLP techniques. I am also interested in developing algorithms to enable computers with the abilities to recognize, analyze and predict subtle human language during social interactions, and thus further facilitate our understanding of human social dynamics.
