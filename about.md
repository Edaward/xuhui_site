# About

My name is Xuhui Zhou. I am a NLP master student at the University of Washington (UW). I got my bachelor degree in Statistics at Nanjing University (NJU). I spent my junior year at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) participating in an international student program, where I made up my mind researching language technologies. 

My research interests include natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, machine learning (ML), and their application in computational social science. Here is my [CV](/report/Xuhui_Zhou_cv.pdf).

I am a big fan of fictions, and like to write some stories from time to time.  

I also love cats, and here is an interesting article discussing [how cats win the Internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/opinion/sunday/how-cats-evolved-to-win-the-internet.html)
