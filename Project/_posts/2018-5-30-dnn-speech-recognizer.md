* Trained and tested models with LibriSpeech. (a corpus of 1,000 hours speech in English)

* Preprocessed the raw audio to Spectrograms and MFCCs. Experimented with with various neural network architectures for acoustic modeling.

* Built an end-to-end automatic speech recognition pipeline with competitive performance.
